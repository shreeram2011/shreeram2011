                <li><p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve Jobs</a>,the co-founder and chief executive of Apple Computer, topped the Computer Weekly 40th anniversary poll due to the devoted following he has generated through his pioneering work in personal computing and product design.</p></li>

                <li><p>Jobs was born in 1955 in San Francisco, and during his high school years he showed his early enthusiasm for computing by attending after-school lectures at the Hewlett-Packard Company in Palo Alto, California. He met fellow Apple founder Steve Wozniak during a summer job at HP.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>In the autumn of 1974, Jobs, who had dropped out of university after one term, began attending meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club with Wozniak. He took a job as a technician at Atari, a manufacturer of popular video games.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>At the age of 21, Jobs saw a computer that Wozniak had designed for his own use, and convinced his friend to market the product.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Apple Computer was founded as a partnership on 1 April 1976. Though the initial plan was to sell just printed circuit boards, Jobs and Wozniak ended up creating a batch of completely assembled computers, and entered the personal computer business.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Their second machine, the Apple II, was introduced the following year and became a huge success, turning Apple into an important player in the nascent personal computer industry.</p></li>
                
                
               <li><p> In 1983, Apple launched the Lisa, the first PC with a graphical user interface (GUI) – an essential element in making computing accessible to the masses. It flopped because of its prohibitive price, but the followin year Apple launched the distinct, lower priced Macintosh and it became the first commercially successful GUI machine.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Despite his success in founding Apple, Jobs left following a boardroom row in 1985. But his influence on the computer industry did not end there.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Jobs moved on to found Next Computer, then in 1986 he bought little known The Graphics Group from Lucasfilm, which achieved global dominance in animated feature films during the 1990s, after being renamed Pixar.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Much of Next’s technology had limited commercial success, but it laid the foundation for future computing developments. The company pioneered the object-oriented software development system, Ethernet port connectivity and collaborative software. It was the Next interface builder that allowed Tim Berners-Lee to develop the original worldwide web system at Cern.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Without Jobs, Apple had stumbled. Market share fell while it struggled to release new operating systems. Its answer was to buy Jobs’ company Next, together with its innovative operating system, and welcome back its charismatic former CEO.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>On returning to Apple, Jobs drove the company ever deeper into the consumer electronics and computing market, launching the iMac and iPod.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Steve Jobs died on 5 October 2011 after a long battle with cancer, but his place in computing history is guaranteed.
